# priceRegression

This project takes a list of about 100,000 cars from 10 different manufacturers and runs analysis on them.

Inititally starting with just Volkswagen, analysis expanded to answer questions such as what is the average age of the cars sitting on the market, what's their average mileage, and can we create a regression that gives us a strong correlation? Check the code for results!
